# Content Moderation Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)

## Overview
This document outlines the standard procedures for content moderation to ensure consistent, fair, and effective review of user-generated content.

## Moderation Principles

### Core Values
- **Transparency**: Clear communication about moderation decisions
- **Consistency**: Apply rules uniformly across all content
- **Fairness**: Give users benefit of the doubt when appropriate
- **Safety**: Prioritize user safety and platform integrity

### Decision Framework
1. **Context Matters**: Consider the overall context of the comment
2. **Intent vs Impact**: Evaluate both the user's intent and potential impact
3. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Be aware of cultural differences in expression
4. **Escalation Path**: When in doubt, escalate to senior moderators

## AI Analysis Guidelines

### Toxicity Scores
- **0-10%**: Generally safe, approve unless other red flags
- **10-30%**: Review carefully, consider context and sentiment
- **30%+**: High risk, typically reject unless clear false positive

### Sentiment Analysis
- **Positive + Low Toxicity**: Fast-track approval
- **Negative + High Toxicity**: Strong candidate for rejection
- **Neutral**: Focus on toxicity score and content analysis

## Common Scenarios & Actions

### 1. Legitimate Negative Feedback
**Scenario**: Customer complains about poor service with constructive criticism
**Example**: "The coffee was cold and service was slow, but staff tried to help"
**Action**: ‚úÖ APPROVE
**Reasoning**: Constructive feedback helps businesses improve

### 2. Personal Attacks on Staff
**Scenario**: Comments attacking individual employees personally
**Example**: "The barista is an idiot and shouldn't work here"
**Action**: ‚ùå REJECT
**Reasoning**: Personal attacks violate dignity standards

### 3. Profanity in Context
**Scenario**: Strong language used for emphasis without targeting anyone
**Example**: "The damn coffee was amazing, best I've had!"
**Action**: ‚úÖ APPROVE (with note)
**Reasoning**: Expressive language without malicious intent

### 4. Discriminatory Content
**Scenario**: Comments containing hate speech or discrimination
**Example**: Any content targeting race, gender, religion, sexuality, etc.
**Action**: üö´ BLOCK + Report
**Reasoning**: Zero tolerance for discrimination

### 5. Spam/Promotional Content
**Scenario**: Comments promoting other businesses or unrelated content
**Example**: "Check out my restaurant instead: [link]"
**Action**: ‚ùå REJECT
**Reasoning**: Platform integrity and fairness to reviewed business

### 6. False Information
**Scenario**: Demonstrably false claims about business practices
**Example**: "They don't wash their dishes" (when health records show otherwise)
**Action**: ‚ùå REJECT
**Reasoning**: Protect businesses from false accusations
