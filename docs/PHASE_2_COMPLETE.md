# Phase 2 Complete: Model Normalization ✅

## What Was Implemented

### 🗄️ **Database Normalization**
- ✅ Added `slug`, `description`, `contact_email`, `contact_phone` to locations table
- ✅ Created `cafes_locations_mapping` table with proper RLS policies
- ✅ Added helper functions: `get_location_by_cafe_id()`, `get_cafe_by_location_id()`
- ✅ Enhanced context function with cafe compatibility
- ✅ Auto-generated slugs for existing locations

### 🔧 **LocationContext Enhancement**
- ✅ Added `CafeMapping` interface for backward compatibility
- ✅ Extended context with new methods:
  - `setActiveLocationBySlug()` - Set location using friendly URL
  - `getCafeByLocationId()` - Get cafe data from location
  - `getLocationByCafeId()` - Get location from cafe ID
  - `activeCafe` - Current cafe mapping for active location

### 🛡️ **Security & RLS**
- ✅ Proper RLS policies on mapping table
- ✅ Security definer functions for data access
- ⚠️ **Auth config warnings remain** (need dashboard config):
  - OTP expiry needs reduction in Auth settings
  - Leaked password protection needs enabling

## 📊 **Backward Compatibility**

### **URL Pattern Support**
- ✅ New: `/tenants/:locationSlug/*` (friendly URLs)
- ✅ Legacy: `/cafe/:cafeId/*` (via mapping functions)
- ✅ Current: `/app/*` (location-aware via context)

### **Component Migration Ready**
Components can now use either pattern:

```typescript
// New way (location-first)
const { activeLocation, activeCafe } = useLocationContext();

// Legacy way (cafe-first with mapping)
const { getLocationByCafeId } = useLocationContext();
const location = await getLocationByCafeId(cafeId);
```

## 🚀 **Next: Phase 3 - Route Restructuring**

Ready to implement:
1. **Tenant routes**: `/tenants/:locationSlug/dashboard`
2. **Role-based routing**: `/tenants/:locationSlug/dashboard/:role`
3. **Gradual migration** with redirects for backward compatibility
4. **Enhanced RoleGuard** integration

### **Estimated Impact**
- 🟢 **Zero breaking changes** - All existing functionality preserved
- 🟢 **Enhanced capabilities** - Slug-based URLs, cafe mapping
- 🟡 **Database normalization** - Single source of truth established
